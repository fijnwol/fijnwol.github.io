    <h3>About Fijnwol</h3>
    <p>Fijnwol produces sustainable wool and alpaca yarn. Originated in Belgium it uses high quality local wool and
      alpaca fibre that would otherwise go to waste. Fijnwol offers natural coloured yarn and yarn hand dyed with plant
      fibres. Also the plants are collected sustainably and when possible used surplus materials such as onion skins or
      plants that are invasive in the nature but produce beautiful and safe colours. Fijnwol yarn is made almost
      entirely without chemicals: wool and alpaca fibre are washed with mild soap. Dyed yarn is pre-mordanted with
      aluin, a natural salt, in order to make the colour fast. No other chemicals are used in processing the materials.

    <h3>Taking care of the yarn</h3>
    <p>Fijnwol yarn is wool and/or alpaca and it is not superwash treated. A washing machine wash is not recommended as the wool might felt. Hand wash in cool water with detergent attended for wool. Dry the garments flat.</p>

    <p>lant dyed yarn might change its colour within time. It can fade if exposed to direct sunlight. The changing of
      the colour usually means that it gets lighter.</p>

    <p>Every skein is unique in colour so alternating skeins is recommended when making a bigger product that uses
      several skeins of yarn. This applies also to the undyed yarn.</p>

    <p>No chemicals are used in processing the yarn. Also moth pestisides are not used.</p>
